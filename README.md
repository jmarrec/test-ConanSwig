# test-ConanSwig

![Build Badge](https://github.com//jmarrec/test-ConanSwig/workflows/build/badge.svg)

A dummy test to see how to resolve SWIG_LIB when using SWIG coming from conan: [swig_installer/4.0.0@bincrafters/stable](https://github.com/bincrafters/conan-swig_installer)

It's also a test of GitHub Actions: it will build the cmake project to test on ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
